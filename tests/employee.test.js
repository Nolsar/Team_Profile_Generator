// // The first class is an `Employee` parent class with the following properties and
// // methods:

// //   * name
// //   * id
// //   * email
// //   * getName()
// //   * getId()
// //   * getEmail()
// //   * getRole() // Returns 'Employee'

// 1 function to ask the initial question of who you are creating
// // 1 function for each of the object types to create (3 all together)
// // after the questions of the current object are done, you call the initial question function

// * You will want to make your methods as pure as possible. This means try to make your methods simple so that they are easier to test.

// * The different employee types should all inherit some methods and properties from a base class of `Employee`.

// * In your HTML template files, you may want to add a placeholder character that helps your program identify where the dynamic markup begins and ends.
